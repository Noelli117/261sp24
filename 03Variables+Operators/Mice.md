1. Write a Python program (named `{yourfamilyname}mice.py`) that prints out the following lines using **only one** `print` function, `\n`, `\t`, and where the number 3 is a value (the result of a calculation):

		3
			Blind
				Mice

2. SUBMIT (as a link canvas to an assignment folder in *your* GitHub repository):
	- Your .py file
	- A documentation file (in Markdown as an .md file!) of the .py file as outlined in the syllabus.
